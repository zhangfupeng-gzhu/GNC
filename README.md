# GNC(A Monte Carlo code for dynamics of Galactic Nuclear star Cluster with a central MBH)
 GNC is a Monte-Carlo numerical method to calculate the dynamical evolution of a cluster of particles around a massive black hole using 2-dimensional (energy-angular momentum) Forkker-Planck methods. The code is written in Fortran 03, and has been tested using gfortran 11.3.0 and open mpi 4.1.2. We haven't tested it using other versions of fortran compiler or open mpi, but probabily work, however. GNC is written by Zhang fupeng, in collabration with Ameau-senaro Pau.
 
The  code and the documentary will be released soon.
