# A Monte Carlo code for dynamics of Galactic Nuclear star Cluster with a central massive black hole

  GNC is a Monte-Carlo numerical method to calculate the dynamical evolution of a cluster of particles around a massive black hole, written by Zhang fupeng, in collabration with Amaro Seoane Pau. Here we present the basic version of the method, incorporates two-body relaxation and the effects of the loss cone. GNC can calculate the two-body relaxation of multiple mass components based on a two-dimensional (energy and angular momentum) Fokker-Planck Monte Carlo method, the steady-state solutions for multiple mass components under given boundary conditions can be obtained.

  The code is written in Fortran 2003, and has been tested using gfortran/openmpi or ifort/mpich.
 
  For details of installation and using the code, please see the Doc/tutorial.pdf.
